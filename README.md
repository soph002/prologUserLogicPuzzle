# prologUserLogicPuzzle
Prolog project that solves a logic puzzle based on user entered options and clues

Project Title: Uncovering the truth behind crimes using Prolog and AI.

Project Creators: Partner Project in AI class

Motivation: The motivation for this project was to be able to have the user generate a mystery logic puzzle and give the AI clues in order to solve the mystery. The goal was to be able to have a user interface so people with no coding experience could use the chat bot. 

Technology information: Prolog through swish was used for the project. Prolog is extremely effective at processing constraint satisfaction problems, and also has the ability to take in user input and process this input. In order to run the code, utilize this link and copy and paste the code into a new program: https://swish.swi-prolog.org/. 

Description: Create a chat bot that asks the user for information that they have regarding suspects, places, and weapons and the connections between them. Prolog then figures out the connections between all the items. 

How to use project:
Copy and paste code into prolog
In prolog command line type play(X). 
Interact with the chat bot and answer the questions that it asks.
Only use lower case letters, no special characters or spaces
When it asks a yes or no question answer yes or no
If the user gives prolog enough information to solve the mysteries, prolog will output the correct solution. If the user gives prolog contradictory information, prolog will output false. If the user does not provide enough information, prolog will randomly fill in the suspects, weapons, or locations that it does not have information about.



Next Steps:
The next steps of the project would be to create a more intuitive user interface perhaps in a different programming language and then have prolog just do the back-end processing. Additionally, we could adapt the output so that prolog warns the user if there is more than one potential solution due to limited information.
